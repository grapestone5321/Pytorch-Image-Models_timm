## Pytorch Image Models (timm)
https://github.com/fastai/timmdocs

timm is a deep-learning library created by Ross Wightman and is a collection of SOTA computer vision models, layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders, augmentations and also training/validating scripts with ability to reproduce ImageNet training results.

### How to use

- Create a model

- List Models with Pretrained Weights

- Search for model architectures by Wildcard

## Deep learning pipeline in 2021 - Best practices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrjP5cPo44

Jarvislabs AI


In this video, we show how a deep learning project needs to be structured based on our past learnings. 

We also discuss some of the challenges large companies like Facebook faces due to the non-standardization of their deep learning pipelines. 

We compare how these issues are relevant for researchers, small and large teams. 

Finally, We also see how most of the deep learning solutions look today and how they could potentially evolve in 2021 and years to come. 

We have used the following frameworks and tools

- PyTorch 
- PyTorch Lightning
- Hydra
- Weights and biases
